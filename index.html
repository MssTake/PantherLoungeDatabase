         The Panther Lounge is recreational space open to all Florida Tech
         students. The lounge is owned by Florida Tech's Student Government
         Association, but it is co-run by The Anime Club and the Florida
         Institute of Technology Science Fiction and Fantasy Club (FITSSFF).
      </p>
      <p hidden id="answer2">
         The Panther Lounge Database and Checkout System is a web application
         designed to help both Anime Club and FITSSFF catalog and organize their
         expansive libraries. The web application is also designed to make the
         checkout system for members and club librarians to use.
      </p>
      <p hidden id="answer3">
         Items were previously cataloged on a series of spreadsheets. Both clubs
         end up with a number of newly-dontated items each semester, so
         catalogging them often becomes unnecessarily tedious for both
         librarians, who are already busy with classwork.
      </p>
      <p hidden id="answer4">
         Each club had their own Google Form. Members would fill out either form
         to notify an item was being checked out. Both Google Forms are
         disconnected to the aforementioned spreadsheets. Items were often
         difficult to track, In extreme cases, items were stolen, sometimes by
         non-members.
      </p>
      <p hidden id="answer5">
         The catalogs and checkout system will be localized on the web app.
         Localizating the two will make it easier for members and librarians from
         both clubs so catalog, checkout, and track items. This will also help
         both clubs with holding members accountable in the event an item goes
         missing.
