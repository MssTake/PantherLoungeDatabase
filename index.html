            The Panther Lounge is recreational space open to
            all Florida Tech students. The lounge is owned by Florida
            Tech's Student Government Association, but it is co-run by
            The Anime Club and the Florida Institute of Technology
            Science Fiction and Fantasy Club (FITSSFF).

            The Panther Lounge Database and Checkout System
            is a web application designed to help both Anime
            Club and FITSSFF catalog and organize their expansive
            libraries. The web application is also designed to
            make the checkout system for members and club librarians
            to use.
         </p>
         <p id="q3">
            Items were previously cataloged on a series of spreadsheets.
            Both clubs end up with a number of newly-dontated items each
            semester, so catalogging them often becomes unnecessarily
            tedious for both librarians, who are already busy with classwork.
         </p>
         <p id="q4">
            Each club had their own Google Form. Members would fill out
            either form to notify an item was being checked out. Both
            Google Forms are disconnected to the aforementioned
            spreadsheets. Items were often difficult to track,
            In extreme cases, items were stolen, sometimes by non-members.
         </p>
         <p id="q5">
            The catalogs and checkout system will be localized on the web app.
            Localizating the two will make it easier for members and librarians
            from both clubs so catalog, checkout, and track items. This will
            also help both clubs with holding members accountable in the event
            an item goes missing.
